(defn start
  "Starts the tekton-watcher service.

  Once started, tekton-watcher watches pipeline and task runs,
  dispatches events according to the status of those resources and
  performs actions based on the triggered events. A simple HTTP server
  starts to listen on the port configured through the
  key :tekton-watcher.server/port in the config map. This HTTP server
  exposes some endpoints that reveal information about the internal
  status of the service. For instance, the route /health/live returns
  detailed information about the health status of the service.

  Returns a 0-arity function that stops the service when
  invoked. Useful for iterating on the REPL."
